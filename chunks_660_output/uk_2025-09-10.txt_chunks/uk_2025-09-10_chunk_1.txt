CONGRATULATING SOUTH DAKOTA'S AIR NATIONAL GUARD'S 114TH FIGHTER WING

_____

HON.
DUSTY JOHNSON

Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize

the South Dakota Air National Guard's 114th Fighter Wing, which

recently received three top national honors at the National Guard

Association of the

United States Conference.
They were awarded the Distinguished Flying

Unit Plaque, the Winston P. Wilson Trophy, and the Major General John

J. Pesch Flight Safety Trophy.
These awards reflect the Wing's nearly 80 years of excellence.
Over

the past year, the 114th deployed twice, once to the Pacific and once

to the Middle East, while maintaining outstanding readiness at home.
Their record has once again placed them among the very best in the

Nation.
This recognition highlights the leadership of Colonel Brandon Eskam

and the commitment of every Airman in the unit.
As Major General Mark

Morrell noted, these honors are not pursued, but earned through

professionalism, discipline, and daily dedication.
The 114th represents

the best of South Dakota and a standard of excellence for the entire

Air National Guard.
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in

congratulating the 114th Fighter Wing on these well-deserved honors and

in thanking them for their service to South Dakota and the United

States.

CONGRATULATING THE TOMLINS, THE 2025 OKALOOSA COUNTY FARM FAMILY OF THE

YEAR

_____

HON.
JIMMY PATRONIS

Mr. PATRONIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Tomlin family of

Crestview, Florida, who have been named the 2025 Okaloosa County

Outstanding Farm Family of the Year.
This recognition is part of the

Okaloosa County Farm Bureau's 75th Annual Membership Meeting, a

gathering that celebrates the strength of our agricultural community.
Cory and Jennifer Tomlin, together with their children Harper,

Hadley, and Haylyn, represent the very best of Florida agriculture.
Their family has carried forward a proud legacy of fanning that began

in 1982 when Jennifer's grandfather, Mr. Joe Bundrick, established

their beekeeping operation.
Today, with the guidance of Mr. Bundrick

and the leadership of Jennifer's father, Ken, the Tomlins manage about

400 hives annually.
Their farm produces honey, provides pollinator

services, and serves the community through both wholesale and retail

operations, including a storefront offering honey and beekeeping

supplies.
The Tomlin family's dedication goes well beyond their farm.
Jennifer

serves as the Children's Ministry Leader at Dorcas Baptist Church,

Harper is an active 4-H member, and every member of the family

contributes to the success of their agricultural operation.
Together,

they exemplify the values of faith, family, and stewardship that

sustain rural communities across America.
Four generations have worked this farm, and the Tomlins are committed

to ensuring it continues for generations to come.
Their story reflects

not only the resilience of farm families in Northwest Florida but also

the essential role of agriculture in our Nation's future.
On behalf of the United States Congress, I commend the Tomlin family

for their outstanding contributions to agriculture and community life.
They are most deserving of this year's recognition as the Okaloosa

County Farm Family of the Year.

HONORING BOB NEWHART

_____

HON.
MIKE QUIGLEY

Mr. QUIGLEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and

legacy of Bob Newhart, TV star and comedian.
In 1972, The Bob Newhart Show premiered and catapulted Bob into a new

tier of critical acclaim, adoration, and commercial success.
Known for

its dry humor and heart, The Bob Newhart Show drew millions of viewers

into a Chicago-based story about a psychologist and his clients and

friends.
With incredibly strong ratings and significant praise, the

show ran for six seasons, leading to his other acclaimed show, Newhart.
