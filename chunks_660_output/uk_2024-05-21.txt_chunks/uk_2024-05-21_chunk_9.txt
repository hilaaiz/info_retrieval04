RESOLUTION REGARDING VIOLENCE AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT

speech of

HON.
SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Ms. JACKSON LEE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.

Res.
1213, ``A resolution regarding violence against law enforcement

officers''.
Sadly, H. Res.
1213 is another hypocritical, partisan attack cloaked

behind a message honoring local law enforcement during National Police

Week.
The resolution is full of misinformation, baseless and dangerous

claims, and political rhetoric that overwhelms its intended purpose and

has no place in what should be an opportunity to bring Congress

together in solemn reflection.
My Republican colleagues have consistently tried to blame the rise in

violent crime on Democrats and locally-elected District Attorneys and

with this resolution have attempted once again to label Democrats as

the party of ``defund the police.''
The resolution asserts without evidence that calls to defund the

police are tied to an increase in violence against law enforcement

officers and further implies that locally adopted progressive criminal

justice reform policies have contributed to the ``negative

environment'' in which law enforcement officers work.
The Resolution fails to acknowledge that the number of officers

killed in the line of duty decreased substantially each year from 586

in 2021 to 137 in 2023.
