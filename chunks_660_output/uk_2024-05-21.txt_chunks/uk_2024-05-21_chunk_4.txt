PDS

needs the authority to spend that $3 million on salaries, or it will be

forced to close one day per week.
My bill would give PDS the authority

to spend that $3 million on salaries.
The drafting error will not only harm PDS employees, who will not be

paid when PDS is closed, it will also harm the local criminal justice

system in D.C. On the days that PDS is closed, PDS attorneys will not

appear in any matter before the D.C. Superior Court, the D.C. Court of

Appeals, the U.S. Parole Commission or other administrative or

adjudicative body.
The local D.C. court system is already facing a

backlog of cases because of a shortage of judges, who are appointed by

the president, subject to Senate confirmation.
The PDS furloughs will

only exacerbate this problem.
This is simply an unacceptable result,

especially when it will have been caused by what everyone acknowledges

is a drafting error, and not a deliberate cut to PDS's funding.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Speaker, I rise to

========================= END NOTE =========================

In 2004, Congress passed the Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act

(LEOSA), permitting qualified active and retired law enforcement

officers to carry concealed firearms and ammunition in certain places.
Every state allows the concealed carry of firearms subject to certain

conditions, but the original LEOSA overrode whatever permit, training,

or other requirements might be in place--with important, commonsense

exceptions for National Parks, playgrounds, government buildings,

private property, and other sensitive areas.
I should note that I was a member of the House Judiciary Committee

when it passed the original LEOSA in 2004.
At that time, the Committee was under Republican control, but it

still followed regular order.
We held a hearing on the bill in which we heard from several law

enforcement organizations.
Some expressed support for the bill as a way for officers to protect

themselves and be able to respond to a dangerous situation whether they

were in their home jurisdiction or not, on-duty or off-duty, active or

retired.
Other law enforcement organizations opposed the legislation,

expressing concerns about creating confusion in the field that might

even endanger law enforcement.
While some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle expressed

concerns about the original LEOSA, I was satisfied that it struck an

appropriate balance.
I supported the original LEOSA because it included limits for special

places.
It had exceptions so that states would still have some control over

whether retired and off-duty law enforcement officers would be allowed

to carry concealed weapons in places like parks, playgrounds, Gun-Free

School Zones, and state and local government buildings.
States should be allowed to regulate these places consistent with the

needs of the state.
Allowing them to do so protects local law enforcement by making sure

they know what to expect when responding to a scene.
The original LEOSA also respected the rights of private property

owners to prohibit concealed weapons on their property if they chose to

do so.
And with respect to retired officers, it ensured that they would

continue to receive annual firearms training so that they would know

how to safely use the concealed firearm that they were carrying.
