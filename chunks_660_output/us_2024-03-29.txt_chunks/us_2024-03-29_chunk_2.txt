For over 40 years, they served as shepherds of the house of Victory Christian Outreach Church, nurturing a membership that at one time exceeded 500 members.
Their leadership extended to the broader community, where they organized years of outreach events serving families, children, and youth with food, clothing, childcare, family counseling, and utility assistance.
In times of crises, their church provided a safe refuge for families in need.
As Senior Pastors, Church Administrators, and Community Leaders, Dr. Lee F. Rice and Dr. Doris V. Rice dedicated themselves to partnering with local churches to share the Gospel and provide a safe place for worship.
Their church became a cornerstone of the community, hosting annual events such as Octoberfest, Be A Blessing, and the Easter Egg Hunt.
Their contributions were recognized by the University City School District, which lauded Victory Christian Outreach Church as an outstanding community contributor.
Pastor Lee and Pastor Doris have also had a profound impact on my life.
They were my personal pastors for many years as well as my employers, and their daughter Daphne, who now serves as the current pastor, has been my very close friend since we were teens.
Their other daughters, Romney and Bryttani, are like sisters.
I am proud to have had the privilege of working at their preschool for a decade, and where I grew to love the important and lifesaving role that childcare providers have in our community.
In honoring the life of Apostle Dr. Lee Rice, we celebrate a man of faith, integrity, and compassion.
His legacy of service

and devotion to God will continue to inspire generations to come.
May his memory be a blessing to all who knew and loved him and may his spirit of love and generosity continue to shine brightly in our community. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the accomplishments of Hermelinda Sapien.
Hermelinda dedicated 55 years to the Center for Employment Training, and for the past 25 years she has displayed her unwavering leadership as President and Executive Director.
The Center for Employment Training (CET) is an economic and community development corporation.
Their job training and placement programs teach marketable skills to people of all educational levels and backgrounds, supporting them through the process of job placement.
With 12 locations, including San Jose's, CET's impact is monumental.
Hermelinda's work with CET began as an Administrative Assistant, and her commitment served her well as she moved up to Human Resources Director, Chief Administrative Officer, Deputy Director, and ultimately, President and CEO.
CET's ability to work with our community and support the dignity of self-sufficiency is largely due to Hermelinda's hard work.
She dedicated her career to ensuring CET's financial stability and guaranteeing that the needs of students at CET were being met.
Thousands of people have received the training and support they needed to find meaningful employment that supports them and their families.
Hermelinda's work and that of all the CET staff has changed lives and our community for the better.
Hermelinda's leadership has made a profound difference.
Hermelinda will be retiring in June of this year, and it is with great pride and respect that I recognize her accomplishments.
I share with CET's Board of Directors in their heartfelt farewell to Hermelinda Sapien, and we will always remember her impact on the Center for Employment Training's success. ____________________
