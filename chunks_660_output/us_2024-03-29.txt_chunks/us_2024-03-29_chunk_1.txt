LEE F. RICE ______ of missouri in the house of representatives Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with the people of St. Louis, to pay tribute to the remarkable life and enduring legacy of Apostle Dr. Lee F. Rice, a dedicated servant of God whose impact extends far beyond the walls of Victory Christian Outreach Church.
Dr. Rice's commitment to spreading the Gospel and serving his community leaves an indelible mark on all who had the privilege of knowing him.
Dr. Rice was more than a pastor; he was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and friend.
He is survived by his loving family, including his adult children: Rhoda Rice, Sardius Rice, Pastor Daphne Rice-Bruce (spouse-Alex Bruce), Minister Romney Rice-Dunn (spouse-Minister Fred Dunn), and Minister Bryttani Rice.
His legacy also lives on through his many grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and countless other cherished family members and friends.
The educational background of Dr. Rice and his beloved wife, the late Apostle Dr. Doris V. Rice, speaks volumes about their commitment to ministry and service.
Both graduated from Rhema Bible Training College in Tulsa, Oklahoma and received Family Counseling Degrees from National Lewis College.
Their dedication to theological education culminated in the attainment of Biblical Studies Doctorate Degrees from Pillsbury Bible College.
For over 40 years, they served as shepherds of the house of Victory Christian Outreach Church, nurturing a membership that at one time exceeded 500 members.
Their leadership extended to the broader community, where they organized years of outreach events serving families, children, and youth with food, clothing, childcare, family counseling, and utility assistance.
In times of crises, their church provided a safe refuge for families in need.
