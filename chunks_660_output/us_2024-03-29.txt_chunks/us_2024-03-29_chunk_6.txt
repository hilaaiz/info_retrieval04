Date: 2024-03-29 Volume: 170, Issue: 54 Pages: E296 - E297 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E296-E297] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING FREMONT OEM AND DOT ______ of colorado in the house of representatives Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Fremont County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) and Department of Transportation (DOT) for their lifesaving work to keep roads clear and restore power during a record-breaking winter storm in March of 2024.
This harsh winter storm brought over thirteen inches of snow and caused major power outages throughout the county.
Staff from the Fremont County Office of Emergency Management, led by Emergency Manager Mykel Kroll, and the Fremont County Department of Transportation, led by Director Mike Whitt, worked overtime and over weekends throughout inclement weather conditions to clear roadways and restore traffic to over 700 miles of mountainous roadways in the county.
Together, they freed an elderly woman who had been trapped in her car by the snow, secured housing for a family who were victims of a fire, restored power to a residential care facility in Florence, rescued a man caught in his vehicle after an avalanche, and helped maintain power for a family with a young child who relies on a supplemental oxygen supply.
Under some of the most extreme conditions possible, Fremont County OEM and DOT did an exemplary job of saving lives and serving our community during this storm.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it is my honor to recognize Florence County Office of Emergency Management and Department of Transportation for their outstanding work and service to our communities. ____________________

Date: 2024-03-29 Volume: 170, Issue: 54 Pages: E297 - E297 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING GEORGE AND SUE CANNELLA ______ of florida in the house of representatives Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions of my constituents, Sue and George Cannella.
Sue has worked at the Pregnancy & Family Life Center (``the Center'') as a volunteer two days a week since 2015.
She is the lead volunteer in the Food Pantry and, as such, shoulders the lion's share of responsibility for ensuring that USDA and non-USDA food items are received, maintained and provided to the Center's clients which includes pregnant Moms, Dads, and families.
Sue is extremely dedicated to the clients at the Center and her work pays off.
Last year alone, more than 6,000 clients were helped in the food pantry and 65,000 pounds of food distributed.
Additionally, Sue ensures moms receive essential items needed for their infants and young children to include formula, diapers, pull ups, baby wipes, and wash, as well as age specific clothing items such as onesies, pajamas, shirts, shorts, pants, and shoes.
She does all of this with a warm smile to greet clients, families, staff, and volunteers alike.
No job is too large or challenging for Sue.
Sue and her husband, George, are quite the team.
George comes to the Center at least one day a week to break down numerous boxes which previously contained food or donations from big box stores such as Big Lots or CVS.
George also performs maintenance as needed throughout the Center.
Sue and George distribute nutritious food boxes monthly to five veterans who otherwise would go without much needed food.
They have selfless, generous, and kind hearts in service to Our Lord and the Center's clients.
They remain a source of inspiration and hope for women experiencing planned and unplanned pregnancies.
They understand that a smile, a kind word, or a joke makes all the difference to families in need.
