Along with others, Betty started a Farmer's Market, which created a wonderful sense of community.
Additionally, she helped create St. Leo's Pasco County Fair Community Booths, made a giant gingerbread house for the St. Leo/SLU Christmas Village, and continues to support St. Leo.
Betty also works to help children in foster care establish a sense of belonging as they transition from placements and works with partners to make sure their primary needs are met.
It is clear that Ms. Betty Burke has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brendan Pardue for being named the Royal Gorge Chamber Alliance's 2023 Distinguished Citizen.
Brendan was raised in Canon City and has spent his life in Colorado.
He attended Regis University and graduated with majors in history, philosophy, and religion and then went on to earn his master's degree in guidance and counseling from the University of Northern Colorado.
In 2005, Brendan purchased the Gibson Mansion and spent years restoring the house and reviving a historic part of Canon City.
Since completing the restoration, Brendan has offered free use of the house to nonprofit organizations for fundraisers and other events.
He has also restored 12 other historic buildings in the area.
Brendan's readiness to assist his community is one of many reasons why he is a fitting recipient of the Royal Gorge Chamber Alliance's recognition.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it is my honor to congratulate Brendan Pardue for earning this award and thank him for his long standing dedication to our community. ____________________

Date: 2024-03-29 Volume: 170, Issue: 54 Pages: E295 - E295 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING CHANHASSEN FIRE CHIEF ANDREW HEGER ______ of minnesota in the house of representatives Mr. EMMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Andrew Heger, who was recently sworn in as the Chief of the Chanhassen Fire Department.
Andrew began his career as a firefighter in 2001 in his hometown of Victoria, and after 15 years of service to the department became the city's first full-time fire chief.
But after more than two decades of service with the Victoria Fire Department, Chief Heger was ready for a new challenge.
When he got the offer to serve as the Chief of the Chanhassen Fire Department, Andrew jumped at the opportunity.
Chief Heger was officially sworn in as Chief earlier this month and will be leading a crew of 26 paid-on-call and 10 full-time firefighters.
Being a firefighter isn't just a job, it's a calling.
It's about being there for people when they need help the most, whether it's a fire, a medical emergency, or just lending a helping hand.
For over two decades, Chief Heger has served communities in Carver County with dedication and bravery.
Chanhassen is fortunate to have such a qualified and experienced leader at the helm of its fire department.
I have every confidence that Chief Heger will continue to build upon the department's strong foundation and work to ensure the safety of the Chanhassen community for years to come. ____________________
