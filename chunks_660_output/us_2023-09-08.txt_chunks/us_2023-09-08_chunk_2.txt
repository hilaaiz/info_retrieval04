Louis Lappe hit a legendary walk-off home run to win the game in the sixth inning.
The team was led by Manager Danny Boehle and Coaches Tim Abrams and Eddie Lee.
I am happy to know that this team had the full support of their city behind them, and residents gathered across the city and Southern California to cheer them on in a wonderful display of community.
Their achievements are made all the more special by the hard work and the team effort made by every player, coach and supporter along the way.
On behalf of California's 36th Congressional District, I would like to sincerely congratulate the El Segundo Little League All-Stars team on winning the Little League World Series and wish them best of luck in their future efforts.
Their performance was a sight to behold, and they have made us all proud.
Go Gundo. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and congratulate Honeywell on 100 years of operations and doing business in South Bend, Indiana.
For a full century now, Honeywell has been a staple in the South Bend community as well as a source of stability and economic opportunity for hardworking Hoosiers in our area.
I often say that Hoosier manufacturing is second to none.
Honeywell's South Bend facility proves this point every single day.
By manufacturing aircraft wheel and brake systems, Honeywell Aerospace helps to keep people in the skies and American aviation safe and constantly on the move.
I had the pleasure of touring their South Bend facility and meeting members of Honeywell's team last month.
There, I was able to see firsthand the quality, professional work Honeywell employees do day in and day out and why Honeywell has chosen a home in South Bend for the past 100 years.
Congratulations again on reaching this impressive milestone.
I thank them for their many contributions to the city of South Bend and Indiana's Second Congressional District.
I wish them continued success and many more years in business and anniversaries to celebrate going forward. ____________________
CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PALOS VERDES PENINSULA; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-09-08 Volume: 169, Issue: 145 Pages: E819 - E819 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PALOS VERDES PENINSULA ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. LIEU.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of the unofficial formation of the Palos Verdes Peninsula community.
One hundred years ago, a small real estate rally took place that is credited with the inception of the Palos Verdes Peninsula.
Today, the Palos Verdes Peninsula is comprised of 4 beautiful cities.
The first city to be incorporated on the peninsula was Palos Verdes Estates in 1939, followed by Rolling Hills and Rolling Hills Estates in 1957, and most recently Rancho Palos Verdes in 1973.
On June 17, 1923, real estate developers hosted a rally to encourage individuals to buy property on the peninsula.
This event invited people to hear about the development plan for the Peninsula and led to one of Nation's first planned communities.
The original site of the rally is where the offices of the Palos Verdes Unified District now stands.
What was once empty land with rolling hills and scenic views has transformed into a beautiful community with an amazing school district, businesses, and homes.
Today, the Peninsula is home to roughly 80,000 residents-- all of whom are my constituents.
