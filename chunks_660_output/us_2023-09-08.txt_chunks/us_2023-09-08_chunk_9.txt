Mr. Speaker, I offer my congratulations to the Republican Study Committee's Senior Policy Counsel, Omar Hossino and his wife Leen, on the birth of their first child, a boy.
Hatem Hossino, named after his paternal grandfather, was born at 8:29 p.m. on Saturday, July 29, 2023, in Arlington, VA.
The name `Hatem' is Arabic for ``decisive,'' ``determined,'' and ``judge.''
The Hossino family traces its lineage to Syria, through the village of Salamiyeh.
As Chairman of the RSC's National Security Task Force, I have long valued Omar's strategic advice.
He has been instrumental in moving forward important policy legislation through the House and continues to be integral to the Committee's congressional staff as it advances policies on behalf of the American people.
Best wishes to Omar, Leen, and all their families on the newest addition to the Hossino family. ____________________
