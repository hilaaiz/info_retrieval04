The original site of the rally is where the offices of the Palos Verdes Unified District now stands.
What was once empty land with rolling hills and scenic views has transformed into a beautiful community with an amazing school district, businesses, and homes.
Today, the Peninsula is home to roughly 80,000 residents-- all of whom are my constituents.
The illustrious history of the Palos Verdes Peninsula was celebrated on June 17, 2023, with Doors Open Peninsula 2023: Celebrating 100 Years of History on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.
Community leaders, residents, elected officials, and business owners worked in conjunction to honor the Peninsula's history.
On behalf of the residents of California's 36th Congressional District, I would like to congratulate the Palos Verdes Peninsula community on their 100-year anniversary and wish the cities a prosperous future.

SIDNEY BUTLER ______ of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. NORMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable individual, Sidney Butler, whose legacy continues to inspire and uplift our community.
Sidney Butler dedicated his life to advocating for justice, community improvement, and school safety, leaving an indelible mark on the citizens of our county.
Mr. Butler's commitment to public service was exemplified by his unwavering presence at council and utilities meetings.
He understood the importance of civic engagement and actively participated in the decisionmaking processes that shaped our community.
One of Sidney's most noteworthy contributions was his tireless work on various community projects, including the extensive remodeling of our beloved train station.
His dedication to these endeavors demonstrated his deep-rooted commitment to enhancing the quality of life for all residents.
Despite facing the challenges posed by his epilepsy disability, Mr. Butler never wavered in his pursuit of a more inclusive society.
He tirelessly advocated for the rights and well-being of individuals with disabilities, serving as a beacon of hope and perseverance.
Remarkably, Mr. Butler never owned a vehicle, yet this never deterred him from reaching his destinations.
He relied on his own two feet or the kindness of others who gave him rides, demonstrating his determination and resourcefulness.
One cannot speak of Mr. Butler without mentioning his famous saying, which encapsulates his unwavering spirit: ``If you cannot run, then walk.
If you cannot walk, then crawl, as long as you keep it moving.''
These words reflect his enduring commitment to progress, no matter the obstacles in his path.
As we remember Sidney Butler today, let us be inspired by his example.
Let us continue the work he started, championing justice, community improvement, and school safety.
In honoring his memory, we ensure that his legacy lives on, motivating us all to ``keep it moving'' towards a better future for our county.

May his legacy continue to guide and inspire us for generations to come. ____________________
