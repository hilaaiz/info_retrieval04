Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the city of Chowchilla's Centennial Celebration being held on September 23rd.
Since its incorporation 100 years ago on February 7, 1923, Chowchilla has distinguished itself as a vibrant agricultural city, idyllically nestled between the cities of Fresno and Merced, with close access to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the Pacific Coastline, and Yosemite National Park.
Chowchilla hosts a rich culture that traces its roots back to the Chowchilla tribe who inhabited the area; the name `Chowchilla' being a byword for bravery to the southernmost end of the Yokuts territory in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley.
At the heart of its celebratory traditions is the Western Stampede Cattle Drive which arrives in Chowchilla every year with great fanfare and excitement, showcasing the city's rich history.
And Downtown Chowchilla displays the city's historical buildings and storefronts.
While home to only about 19,000 people, it's the birthplace of Ronald D. Moore, best known for his work on Star Trek, and Cameron Worrell, former NFL player of the Chicago Bears.
Chowchilla is now a part of a unique collective history--along with other small communities such as Kerman and Patterson--that emerged from the foresight of a real estate promoter O.A. Robertson who envisioned the productive and agricultural significance of the area to California's Central Valley.

Date: 2023-09-08 Volume: 169, Issue: 145 Pages: E815 - E815 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING EL SEGUNDO'S LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONSHIP ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. LIEU.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the El Segundo Little League All-Stars, a baseball team from the City of El Segundo, who won the 2023 Little League Baseball World Series on the 27th of August.
El Segundo defeated the Pabao Little League of Willemstad, Curacao in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.
This year's championship win is the first for a team from Los Angeles County since 1993 and is the first for a team from the City of El Segundo.
The El Segundo Little League All-Stars--Lennon Salazar, Finley Green, Quinn Boehle, Lucas Keldorf, Colby Lee, Max Baker, Brody Brooks, Declan McRoberts, Ollie Parks, Louis Lappe, Crew O'Connor, and Jaxon Kalish-- should be proud of their accomplishment, as they have secured the 8th total title for the State of California, the most of any State in the union.
The El Segundo Little League team won 5 consecutive elimination games to compete in the championship and took home the win in a 6-5 game.
Louis Lappe hit a legendary walk-off home run to win the game in the sixth inning.
The team was led by Manager Danny Boehle and Coaches Tim Abrams and Eddie Lee.
I am happy to know that this team had the full support of their city behind them, and residents gathered across the city and Southern California to cheer them on in a wonderful display of community.
