Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate both Allan and Kim Overhiser for their incredible service to Allegan County and on their induction to the prestigious Michigan Farmers Hall of Fame.
It is an honor to express my gratitude for their dedication and commitment to our community and Southwest Michigan.
Mr. Allan Overhiser was raised on the Overhiser farm and decided to follow in his family's fruit growing tradition.
When his father retired, Allan and Kim Overhiser took over the business and became the fifth generation of family farmers.
Under their combined leadership, the farm has expanded to 325 acres and includes more than 30,000 fruit trees.
Allan and Kim have brought on their son, Alex, to continue managing the family's farming operations.
Coinciding with his agricultural and business leadership, Allan has also diligently served his community.
Allan spent 16 years as the Casco Township Clerk from 1988 to 2004 and has continued his service as the Township Supervisor since he was first elected in 2004.
On Allan's watch, his constituents have directly benefitted from the development of a 20-acre park overlooking Lake Michigan, the creation of the South Haven Area Water and Sewer Authority, and the establishment of the South Haven Area Emergency Services Authority.
He is a recipient of the Michigan Horticultural Society Distinguished Service Award.
In addition to helping run their family farm, Kim Overhiser has also distinguished herself as a community leader.
She is a founding member of the Michigan Agritourism Association, a board member for the Lakeshore Harvest Country Association, a Cub Scout leader, and as a strong supporter of Fennville High School Athletics and Bands.
Kim's passion for service has helped make Southwest Michigan an even better place to live, work, and raise a family.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for joining me to congratulate Allan and Kim Overhiser on their well-deserved Hall of Fame induction and for their years of dedicated service to Allegan County and Michigan's 4th Congressional District. ____________________
