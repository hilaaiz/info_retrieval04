118



Date: 2023-07-11 Volume: 169, Issue: 118 Pages: E655 - E655 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SANDY BARBER ______ of texas in the house of representatives Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions to the Fannin County community by Sandy Barber.
For over 22 years, Mrs. Barber has served as the Executive Director of the Fannin County Children's Center, and she has over 31 years of experience in the nonprofit and child welfare sectors.
A native of Arlington, Mrs. Barber graduated from Austin College in Sherman, Texas.
Her passion for child welfare services originates from her longtime desire to help put an end to the victims of abuse.
Under her leadership, Fannin County Children's Center has expanded its community programs and outreach to assist children who have been abused and neglected.
Some of these efforts include expanding mental health services, offering emergency resources and providing clothing.
Mrs. Barber also oversaw the purchase and renovation of their current facility in Bonham, Texas.
Moreover, Mrs. Barber has served on the board for Texas Court Appointed Special Advocates and the Children's Advocacy Centers of Texas.
To recognize her outstanding work, she was named the Texoma Regional Citizen of the Year and Bonham Citizen of the Year.
Mrs. Barber also received the Athena Leadership Award and the Angels in Adoption Award in 2019.
I'm confident that many young people have been inspired by Mrs. Barber's efforts and have no doubt that they will follow her footsteps to help prevent horrific acts of child abuse.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol to recognize Mrs. Barber's important contributions to the children of North Texas.
May God Bless her. ____________________
HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL J. FRAIOLI; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-07-11 Volume: 169, Issue: 118 Pages: E657 - E657 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL J. FRAIOLI ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. SHERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues Congressman Jim Costa and Congressman Raul Grijalva, to pay tribute to our long-time friend and advisor Michael Fraioli, who passed away after a courageous battle with leukemia.
Mike was a devoted husband and father and is survived by his wife of 27 years, Carol Eickert, his beloved children Michelle and Matthew, and his brother Tom.
A Central Valley kid, Mike was born in Modesto, California and was a long-time resident of Chevy Chase, MD.
After working in his hometown of Modesto on the successful campaign electing Tony Coelho to the U.S. House of Representatives, Mike moved to Washington, D.C. to begin his long and successful career in politics as a strong Democrat.
Mike was the founder and owner of Fraioli & Associates, where he advised some of the highest-level Democrats in Congress and was a vocal advocate for a variety of labor organizations including IAMAW, IBEW, and AFL-CIO.
Mike made an indelible impact on both my political journey and my life.
I had the honor to work with Mike since 1996, a few months before I was elected to Congress.
I spent thousands of hours with Mike over a period of 27 years--and I enjoyed every hour.
