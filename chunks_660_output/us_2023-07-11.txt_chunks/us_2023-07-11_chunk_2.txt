Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Stotlar Pharmacy of Pinckneyville, Illinois, for its over 90 years of service to Perry County residents.
This is a true American success story: a family owned and operated small business in the heart of one of the region's best small cities.
Stotlar Pharmacy was founded in 1932 by Joe Stotlar.
At the time of its founding, the Stotlar Pharmacy not only filled prescriptions, but had a soda fountain, sold toiletries, gifts, film, cameras, similar to what many would consider an ``old time'' drug store.
In the 1960s, the pharmacy saw many changes, which included moving across the street from their original location, and now offering pharmacy services, delivery, and a gift shop.
Joe Stotlar's sons, Jim and Gene, were physicians with offices close by as they assisted in overseeing the store after their father.
The family tradition continues today with Joe's grandchildren: Bill, Barbara, Tom, and Rich.
His grandchildren are now serving as the proud owners and managers of Stotlar Pharmacy.
Joe's family remembers him as a very good businessman who was willing to help out anyone in their time of need.
With all the Stotlar family has given to our community, I am proud to now give them the recognition they deserve.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the Stotlar Pharmacy for all they do to keep Southern Illinoisans happy and healthy.
We are fortunate to have such strong family businesses in Southern Illinois, something that should inspire the next generation of community leaders to come. ____________________
