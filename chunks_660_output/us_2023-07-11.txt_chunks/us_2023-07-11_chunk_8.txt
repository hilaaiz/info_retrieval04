Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 100th birthday of Vivian Litchard, a woman who answered the call of duty at the tender age of 18 and served our country with dignity in its darkest hours.
Though she may say ``It really wasn't a big deal, its just what we all did'', we know that without the skilled workers assembling B-24 Liberators in Willow Run, the result of the war may have been much different.
We thank her for her service, and wish her much laughter and blessings in her 101st year.
I thank Vivian. ____________________
REMEMBERING ROY HERRON; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
118



Date: 2023-07-11 Volume: 169, Issue: 118 Pages: E656 - E656 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING ROY HERRON ______ of tennessee in the house of representatives Mr. COHEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a devoted public servant and dear friend, former Tennessee State Senator Roy Herron, who died on Saturday after injuries sustained in a jet ski accident at the age of 69.
Roy was a multi-faceted man of the people--a lawyer and Methodist minister, who served in the state House and Senate for 26 years and was the Democratic nominee for the 8th Congressional District in 2010.
He also wrote three books about the role of faith in politics and a fourth book about Tennessee political humor, co-authored with his friend Cotton Ivy.
A gifted politician, Roy was first elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1986 to fill the seat vacated when Ned McWherter became governor.
He served in the House in the 95th through 99th Tennessee General Assemblies and in the Senate in the 100th through 107th, where he served as floor leader and then chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
He was my Senate colleague from 1997 until I left the state Senate and came to Congress in 2007.
He also chaired the Select Committee on Children and Youth, the Senate General Welfare, Health and Human Resources Committee, and the Joint Tenncare Oversight Committee.
He was a member of the Senate Finance, Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Government Operations Committee, the Joint Committee on Charitable Gaming, and the Joint Select Committee on Education.
I was hopeful that we would be colleagues in Washington when he declared his candidacy for Congress in 2009 after John Tanner announced his retirement.
Roy campaigned throughout the 8th District in his old red Ford pickup.
Despite receiving the endorsement of every major Tennessee newspaper, he lost the general election to Stephen Fincher, a cotton farmer who refused to debate him, as Tennessee took a hard right turn.
In 2011, he was seriously injured in a bicycling accident while training for an Iron Man competition.
He later served as chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party from 2013 to 2015.
Roy graduated at the top of his class at the University of Tennessee at Martin in 1975 and was chosen as a Rotary Scholar and spent a year studying religion at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.
Returning to Tennessee, he received both a master's degree in Divinity and a J.D. from Vanderbilt University in 1980.
Besides his accomplishments and dedication to public service, Roy will be remembered as a truly nice guy.
I extend my deepest condolences to his wife Nancy and his sons John, Rick and Ben, and his many friends and supporters.
His was a life well lived, and he will be missed. ____________________
