========================= END NOTE ========================= The many awards and accolades he has received over the years-- including Firefighter of the Year from Clay Township, Fire Chief of the Year from the state of Indiana, the President's Award from the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the Sagamore of the Wabash award--are all a testament to Timm's commitment to excellence and an accomplished career spent in the service to others.
The broader South Bend community and St. Joseph County are unquestionably better off and safer thanks to this good man who exemplifies what it means to be a leader and a true public servant.
Timm's example and leadership are also reminders that first responders are on the frontlines of some of the most difficult situations our communities face.
When there is a problem, first responders like Timm answer the call and willingly put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe, and for that all of us are extremely grateful.
I am proud to join so many Hoosiers throughout Indiana's Second District in expressing our appreciation to Chief Schabbel for his service and in wishing him and his family all the best going forward during Timm's very well-deserved retirement.
I thank Timm. ____________________

Date: 2024-02-23 Volume: 170, Issue: 33 Pages: E177 - E177 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING FRANCIS `FRANK' HUMMEL, JR. ______
of new jersey in the house of representatives Mr. KIM of New Jersey.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the selfless service and incredible accomplishments of Francis `Frank' Hummel, Jr., a United States Army Veteran, who passed earlier this month.
Born and raised in Philadelphia, Frank spent his adult life in southern New Jersey.
In December 1950, he joined the United States Army where he completed his basic training on Joint Base McGuire-Dix- Lakehurst, right in his own backyard.
Frank was then transferred to a small town in Germany where he went through military intelligence training and served in the Army Security Agency.
During this time, Frank enjoyed boxing, playing center and linebacker for the Seventh Army Special Troops Ramblers football team, and being a member of the 97th Signal Satans basketball team.
Today, we all remember him for his brave service, and love for sports with his fellow soldiers.
After the Army, Frank opened his own mechanical engineering firm, Hummel Engineering Corporation, which served New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware.
Frank also served as the Executive Vice President and then President of the Mechanical Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania, and was the Secretary of the National Certified Pipe Welding Bureau of Philadelphia.
Beyond that he was a member of the Christian Business Men's Association, where he helped mentor young men to succeed in their faith, business, and life's endeavors.
Frank also taught project management at the Pennsylvania State University, Media campus.
A man of faith, Frank was an active member of his congregations and served on many church boards throughout the years.
Formerly a member of Cherry Hill Baptist Church, he most recently was a member of Grace Baptist Church in Mount Laurel.
Frank was active in supporting Christian mission work around the world and was an author in the Wiley Mission Community Newspaper.
Frank was not only a veteran, entrepreneur, and man of faith, he was a family man who loved spending time with his large family.
