Formerly a member of Cherry Hill Baptist Church, he most recently was a member of Grace Baptist Church in Mount Laurel.
Frank was active in supporting Christian mission work around the world and was an author in the Wiley Mission Community Newspaper.
Frank was not only a veteran, entrepreneur, and man of faith, he was a family man who loved spending time with his large family.
He was known to spend his time visiting historical societies, libraries, and cemeteries across the United States and Europe where he listened to and learned about histories from ancestors and distant family members.
He enjoyed recording family genealogy by hand, writing stories about his life experiences, and photography.
Frank married Lorraine Miller in 1951 and in their over 70 years of marriage, they had three children, eleven grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
While many community members locally know Frank and his positive impact in our community, today I'm proud to honor his tenure as a veteran of the United States Army, and husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.
We are lucky to have his inspiration in our community. ____________________
