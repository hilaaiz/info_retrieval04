Date: 2024-02-23 Volume: 170, Issue: 33 Pages: E174 - E175 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E174-E175] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BRIANA DANIEL AS A DISTINGUISHED LEADER IN CENTRAL FLORIDA FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH ______ of florida in the house of representatives Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, during a run in Orlando in 2013, Briana Daniel encountered the stark reality of homelessness.
Motivated to help but inexperienced in addressing this issue, she chose to immerse herself by living among the Downtown Orlando homeless community for over a month.
Through firsthand experience and conversations with them, she discovered their profound need for dignity through cleanliness.
This insight led her to establish Street Team Movement Inc., an organization dedicated to offering hygiene services to the homeless community.
``It's hard to have dignity or feel like you have value when you have nowhere to wash and no way to clean your clothes or yourself,'' said Daniel.
Street Team Movement Inc. provides laundry services to the unhoused and hygiene items distributed through their hygiene vending machines.
The machines are accessible for free to the homeless through their proprietary ``Hope Cards,'' which are special access cards allowing the population a limited number of transactions per week.
``We believe in compassionate assistance, not just handouts.
The `Hope Card' allows us to help without enabling dependency.
We provide individuals the means to access items, and services while preventing any misuse,'' said Daniel.
In 2021, Street Team Movement launched a special program specifically for homeless women called Project Lioness.
The program aims to bridge the hygiene gap for unhoused women by connecting them to critical feminine hygiene kits that will carry them through their monthly cycle.
To date, Project Lioness has distributed over 1,000 hygiene kits stocked with panty liners, feminine napkins, tampons, and wipes.
To date, Street Team Movement has washed over 30,000 loads of laundry, provided over 500 haircuts, and has given out over one million hygiene items.
Since launching the hygiene vending machines in 2020, Street Team Movement has given out over 5,000 hygiene kits in five States.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and congratulate Chief Timm Schabbel, who recently retired as Fire Chief of the Clay Fire Territory in South Bend, Indiana, after 35 impressive years with the department.
During his nearly four decades in public safety, Timm has served in different roles within the fire department, including as a firefighter, Engineer, Lieutenant, Chief of Operations, and Fire Chief.
Timm was promoted to Fire Chief in 1997, making him the longest tenured chief officer in the agency's 75-year history.
Under Chief Schabbel's leadership, Clay Fire became the first internationally accredited fire department in Indiana.
In addition, Clay Fire also expanded under Chief Schabbel's tenure, essentially tripling the area the department covers.
These achievements were only possible thanks to Timm's vision and determination.
