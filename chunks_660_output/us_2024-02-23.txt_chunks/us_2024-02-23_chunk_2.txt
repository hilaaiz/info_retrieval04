44, I recorded my vote as Present.
The reason for my vote is as follows: All acts of sexual violence are horrific.
We should all be fighting to end it here at home and all over the world.
So, while this resolution rightly denounces any sexual committed by Hamas, I am disturbed that it completely ignores and erases any sexual abuse and violence committed by Israeli forces against Palestinians, especially children.
War crimes cannot justify more war crimes.
We must stand up for everyone's safety and human rights, no matter their faith or ethnicity.
There are numerous, well-documented reports of sexual violence, including rape, committed by Israeli forces against Palestinians in their custody.
Children detained and stripped to their underwear in public, for the world to see.
The UN and human rights groups have raised alarms for years--but Congress has never cared.
We all have a responsibility to denounce sexual violence in all forms, regardless of who is responsible.
This resolution falls well short of that responsibility.
Mr. Speaker, outreach was made to the sponsor of H. Res.
966 on several occasions to support the inclusion of Palestinians who had been victims of sexual violence into the Resolution.
However, the sponsor denied adding in any language that supports the well-documented fact that Palestinians have faced many atrocities similar to those described in the Resolution.
Sexual violence is abhorrent and must be fully investigated and prosecuted.
The intentional omission of Palestinian lived experiences in this resolution is dehumanizing and a disservice to survivors everywhere. ____________________
