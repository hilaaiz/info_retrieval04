Mr. Speaker, I rise today in appreciation for a member

of my staff for her dedicated service to the people of Kansas.
Monet

Straub has been an invaluable member of my team since she joined my

staff in 2017 when I was still serving as State Treasurer.
Monet has

worked tirelessly as my Deputy District Director for the past 2\1/2\

years--helping thousands of Kansans from across the Second

Congressional District navigate our federal agencies through high-

quality and reliable constituent services.
From organizing the Topeka office to running Mobile office hours,

Monet's dedication, patience, and hard work have been vital in ensuring

the success of our district operation.
Most importantly, Monet always

put our constituents first and Kansans knew they could count on her to

get the job done.
I am grateful for Monet's positive attitude and

dedication to service over these past 6 years.
I wish her the very best

and look forward to seeing her excel in her new endeavors.
