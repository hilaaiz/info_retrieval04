RECOGNIZING LINDSEY HATCHER ON HER OFFER OF APPOINTMENT TO ATTEND THE

UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY

HON.
ROBERT E. LATTA

Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special

tribute to an outstanding student from Ohio's Fifth Congressional

District.
I am pleased to announce that Lindsey Hatcher of Van Wert,

Ohio, has been offered an appointment to the United States Military

Academy in West Point, New York.
Lindsey's offer of appointment permits her to attend the United

States Military Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2029.
Attending one of our Nation's military academies not only offers the

opportunity to serve our country but also guarantees a world-class

education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding

experiences of their lives.
Lindsey brings a tremendous amount of

leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2029.
While attending Lincolnview High School, she participated in science

club, band, student government, and was on the honor roll.
Throughout

high school, Lindsey was involved in track and field and golf, earning

her varsity letter in both.
I am confident that she will carry the

lessons of her student and athletic leadership to the Military Academy.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Lindsey

Hatcher on her offer of appointment to the United States Military

Academy.
Our service academies offer the finest military training and

education available, and I am positive that Linsdey will excel during

her career at the Military Academy.
I ask my colleagues to join me in

extending their best wishes to her as she begins her service to our

Nation.
