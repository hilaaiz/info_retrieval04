Date: 2024-02-05 Volume: 170, Issue: 20 Pages: E112 - E112 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LEGACY OF JOSEPH ANTHONY ``AMP'' FIDDLER ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the life and legacy of Joseph Anthony Fiddler, better known as ``Amp,'' as we mourn his passing.
Amp Fiddler was born May 16, 1958 in Detroit, Michigan.
His family instilled in him a deep appreciation for music.
He grew up surrounded by the sounds of Detroit's Motown, rock, jazz, and funk.
As a child, Mr. Fiddler studied piano and eventually keyboard.
He found his first professional work as a musician with Enchantment, a Detroit-based soul act.
He was eventually discovered by the legendary George Clinton and went on to perform regularly with Parliament-Funkadelic between 1985 and 1996.
It was during this time that Fiddler honed his skills on the keyboard and synthesizers, contributing significantly to the band's distinctive sound.
Beyond his work with P-Funk, Fiddler collaborated with notable artists such as Prince, Seal, and Maxwell.
His studio, Camp Amp, became a hub for aspiring musicians.
He mentored J Dilla, another notable Detroit musician, putting him on the path to developing his signature style.
Fiddler enjoyed a successful solo career, marked by his blending of classic funk with contemporary sound, in addition to his numerous collaborations.
Despite his stellar career, Fiddler always remained humble and dedicated to his craft and community.
Please join me in recognizing the musical contributions of Amp Fiddler, a true guiding force for Detroit's musical culture, as we mourn his loss. ____________________
