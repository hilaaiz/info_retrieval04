Richard was born in Troy, New York on July 28, 1950.
After graduating from Cohoes High School, Richard enlisted with the United States Army in October 1967.
He served in the Army for three years, rising to the rank of Specialist Fourth Class, before he was honorably discharged in October 1970.
For his service, Richard was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and M16 Expert and M14 Sharpshooter badges.
Richard remained with the Army Reserves until 1973.
Returning to civilian life, Richard married the love of his life Christine Hogan Santspree in April 1971.
They moved to Cohoes and started their family together, raising three children; Kimberly, Richard Jr., and Thomas.
Richard spent his professional career with General Electric in Schenectady, working as a machinist for four decades before retiring in August 2010.
Richard was a well-rounded member of the Cohoes and Troy communities, participating in his local church, veterans' organizations, and recreational activities.
He was a member of the Cohoes Moose Club, the Cohoes-Waterford Elk's Lodge 1317, and the American Legion Ruane Post 476.
Richard competed in a league at the Cohoes Bowling Arena, along with the Cohoes Rod and Gun Club's Dart and Horseshoe League.
Richard assisted with St. Rita's Church's annual bazaar, as well as the Rod and Gun Club's kids' fishing contest at the Van Schaick Island pond.
More than anything, he was a proud family man who enjoyed travelling and spending time with his wife, children, and three grandchildren.
On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, I am honored to recognize the life of Mr. Richard E. Santspree, defined by exemplary service to his community and his country. ____________________

Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I want to honor the accomplishments of Aiden Inman, Ethan Scattone, and William Will, students at Oakcrest High School who competed in the SIFMA Foundation Capitol Hill Challenge and placed tenth in the Nation.
They participated as a part of their Stock Market and Investments class under the guidance of their teacher, Joe Cirigliano and their supervisor Nicole Gazia.
This exemplary group of students participated in a 14-week competition where they managed a hypothetical $100,000 online portfolio of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ESG investments, and cash.
Out of a student participation of over 6,500 students, Oakcrest placed in the top ten performing teams in the nation.
I am incredibly proud of these students and all of their accomplishments, and I can't wait to see the big things they do in the future.
God Bless these students and God Bless the United States of America. ____________________

Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, this August, I had the pleasure of attending Thomas Tran's Eagle Scout Court of Honor.
Thomas has been actively involved in the Scouts since the third grade when he joined as a cub scout.
He quickly climbed the ranks and became an active member of Troop 94, leading the group as their Patrol Leader.
Since then, he has earned an impressive 28 merit badges for his hard work and dedication.
The proudest moment of Thomas's Scouting journey was his Eagle Scout project where Thomas organized the removal and replacement of an old billboard welcome sign at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 8098 in Egg Harbor Township.
This massive undertaking demanded 130 hours of his time and the South Jersey community is thankful for his efforts.
