In 1972, the 349th joined the active component in flying and maintaining the C-5 ``Galaxy'' making the 349th a two-weapon system reserve strategic airlift wing.
On February 1, 1992, the 349th was re-designated the 349th Airlift Wing, deleting the word ``military'' from its name to conform with the active-duty Air Force's reorganization and realignment policies.
In September 1994, the KC-10 ``Extender'' tanker mission was added to the Wing and became an ``Air Mobility Wing,'' the only Air Force Reserve unit at the time to fly three types of aircraft: the C-141 ``Starlifter,'' the C-5 ``Galaxy,'' and

the KC-10.
With the C-17 ``Globemaster III'' arrival at Travis in Summer 2006, the wing and its host became the only units in the country to fly three major weapons systems.
On May 25, 2006, the 301st Airlift Squadron converted from the C-5 to the C-17 and on June 25, 2006, the 945th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron was activated to support the Globemaster III.
Most recently the 349th Aeromedicine Squadron deployed reserve medical personnel in support of New York City's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and 61 Wing Airmen deployed in support of Operation Allies Refuge.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore and colleagues, please join me in praising the dedicated service of the Air Force reservist assigned to the 349th Air Mobility Wing (Reserve), Travis AFB, CA, who give and have given of their time and talents to serve our Nation and support our military readiness.
I thank them for their commitment and sacrifice to help keep our U.S. Air Force strong and prepared for action when called upon. ____________________
HONORING THE LIFE OF UKRAINIAN AIR FORCE MAJOR ANDRII PILSHCHYKOV; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-10-17 Volume: 169, Issue: 170 Pages: E984 - E984 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF UKRAINIAN AIR FORCE MAJOR ANDRII PILSHCHYKOV ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. LIEU.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to recognize the life and service of Ukrainian Air Force Major Andrii Pilshchykov, a fighter pilot who tragically lost his life in the fight to defend his country from the Russian invasion.
Mr. Pilshchykov reached the rank of Captain in the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade of the Ukrainian Air Force, before being posthumously promoted to Major.
Born in Kharkiv only 30 years ago, Andrii fulfilled his life-long dream to fly some of the fastest and toughest airplanes in the world.
From a young age, Andrii was fascinated with airplanes and jets and eagerly took on the little-known hobby of ``Planespotting,'' in which participants track the movement and record photos of desired aircraft all around the globe.
As soon as he could, Andrii enrolled in Ukraine's Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University.
It was in this academy that Andrii learned to fly MiG-29 fighter jets, which he would go on to fly during the current war to save his country.
Andrii's peers and instructors were so impressed with his abilities that he was assigned to be an instructor for certain classes even though he was still a cadet.
After graduating from the academy in 2018, Andrii joined the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade at Yasylkiv Air Base, where he would become an Air Force Captain.
During his first year, Andrii traveled to my home state of California, where he completed an internship with the 144th Fighter Wing of California's Air National Guard in the City of Fresno.
As he learned how to fly F-15 fighter jets, Andrii took his learning experience in California very seriously, earning the nickname ``Juice'' because he would only order juice as he refrained from alcohol.
He took this nickname back home with him, and for a time he was the only pilot in the Ukrainian Armed Forces with an official call sign: ``Juice.''
