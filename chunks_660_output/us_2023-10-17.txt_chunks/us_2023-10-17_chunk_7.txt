It was also recently announced that CHC received a five-million-dollar grant through the American Rescue Plan to open a new location to serve more patients on Cape Cod.
The new facility will be LEED silver certified and include affordable housing to support the community and workforce.
Since 2003, CHC has been led by CEO, Karen Gardner.
Under Ms. Gardner's leadership, CHC continues to grow and evolve to better serve its patients.
Over the last two decades, CHC has built a 33,000 square foot facility in Mashpee; added oral health, women's health, 340B pharmacy, and vision services; implemented an electronic medical record system; and was designated a federally qualified health center in 2006.
Whether it be transportation or insurance costs, Community Health Center of Cape Cod continuously works to break down barriers to accessing quality healthcare.
By combining the different skills and backgrounds of its board members and staff, CHC always strives to provide the best healthcare to the community that it serves, especially those from vulnerable populations.
Over the last 25 years, CHC has operated with the goal of providing high-quality, comprehensive, and affordable care regardless of a person's ability to pay and has established itself as a pillar of the Cape Cod community.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I am proud to honor Community Health Center of Cape Cod, and I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating its 25th anniversary and wishing CHC continued success in the years to come. ____________________

Date: 2023-10-17 Volume: 169, Issue: 170 Pages: E985 - E985 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE CHARITABLE WORK OF THE FUTCH FAMILY ______ of florida in the house of representatives Mr. POSEY.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I would like to recognize Dawn Futch, her husband Mike Futch, and their daughter Stephanie Futch for their charitable service towards the people of Brevard County.
After the sudden and tragic passing of Dawn and Mike's son Michael-Gene, the Futch family created the Michael-Gene Kids Basketball Foundation.
When Michael-Gene Futch passed away in November of 2010, his family requested basketballs instead of flowers due to Michael-Gene's love of the sport.
When over 1,500 basketballs came, the Futch family decided to donate those basketballs to underprivileged children in Brevard County.
This charitable donation led to the creation of the Michael-Gene Kids Basketball Foundation, which aims to help underprivileged families.
Since the Foundation was formed, it has grown far past donations of basketballs.
While continuing basketball donations year-round, the Futch Foundation also hosts a back-to-school drive, sponsor-a-family thanksgiving, and a gift drive for the holiday season.
The Futch Family also holds an annual black-tie affair to raise money for charity.
The Futch family plans to continue their many years of charity work for the children of Brevard County.
I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in recognizing the Futch family and saluting their selfless service.
The Michael-Gene Kids Basketball Foundation is an inspiration and blessing to underprivileged children, and families in our community. ____________________
