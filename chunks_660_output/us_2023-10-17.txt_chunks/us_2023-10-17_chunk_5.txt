During his first year, Andrii traveled to my home state of California, where he completed an internship with the 144th Fighter Wing of California's Air National Guard in the City of Fresno.
As he learned how to fly F-15 fighter jets, Andrii took his learning experience in California very seriously, earning the nickname ``Juice'' because he would only order juice as he refrained from alcohol.
He took this nickname back home with him, and for a time he was the only pilot in the Ukrainian Armed Forces with an official call sign: ``Juice.''
After leaving the Air Force for only a brief period, Andrii did not hesitate to sign up again for service in February 2022 as the Russian invasion threatened the people and very sovereignty of Ukraine.
It was not long before he resumed flights, fighting to keep Ukrainian skies safe over Kyiv and other major battle areas.
During Andrii's service, he flew over 100 combat missions and destroyed dozens of the enemy's command posts.
In May 2022, Andrii was awarded the Order for Courage (3rd Class) for his valiant service.
Because of his keen interest in promoting the modernization of Ukraine's Air Force, and his proficiency in English, Andrii and a small contingent of his colleagues were sent to Washington, D.C., to illustrate and emphasize the urgent need to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets.
I had the honor of meeting Andrii.
After his visit to Capitol Hill, the Ukraine Fighter Pilots Act was introduced, which I was proud to cosponsor.
I want to express my deepest appreciation for the invaluable service rendered not only to the nation of Ukraine, but in the fight for democracy itself, by Major Andrii Pilshchykov.
My deepest condolences go out to his family, the people of Ukraine and all those impacted by his loss. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE NO FENCING AT THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL COMPLEX ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
170



Date: 2023-10-17 Volume: 169, Issue: 170 Pages: E983 - E983 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE NO FENCING AT THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL COMPLEX ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I introduce the No Fencing at the United States Capitol Complex Act, which would prohibit the installation of new permanent fencing on the grounds of the United States Capitol complex.
I am pleased that Senator Chris Van Hollen is introducing this bill in the Senate.
After the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, the Capitol complex became an untraversable fortress surrounded by frightening fences capped with barbed wire--typical of authoritarian regimes.
Although more needs to be done to protect the Capitol complex, the failure of Capitol security leaders to plan for the predictable and openly announced attack on the Capitol on January 6th does not justify closing the complex to the public, to whom it belongs.
We can and must maintain our commitment to security without sacrificing public access by using the least restrictive means necessary to address security.
The January 6th attack on the Capitol, which had little to do with the lack of permanent fencing, was the greatest intelligence and security failure in the history of our nation's capital.
There were countless security failures on January 6th that we can and must address, including: taking threats of extremist violence seriously at an earlier stage; closing the Capitol building grounds during high- profile and high-threat events, as is typically done, but was not done on January 6th; manpower; building security; and training.
Permanent fencing, which is incredibly imprecise, would not address those security lapses.
It is more likely to keep out children, joggers and tourists than a coordinated attack on the Capitol.
