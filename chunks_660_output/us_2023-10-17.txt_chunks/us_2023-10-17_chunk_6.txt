There were countless security failures on January 6th that we can and must address, including: taking threats of extremist violence seriously at an earlier stage; closing the Capitol building grounds during high- profile and high-threat events, as is typically done, but was not done on January 6th; manpower; building security; and training.
Permanent fencing, which is incredibly imprecise, would not address those security lapses.
It is more likely to keep out children, joggers and tourists than a coordinated attack on the Capitol.
In fact, it is a form of security theater--it would make the Capitol ``look'' safer but mask the lack of state-of-the-art security measures that could prevent attacks in the future.
Every threat to the Capitol since January 6th has been stopped by longstanding and new security measures and the excellent work of the Capitol Police.
Permanent fencing would not aid the Capitol Police in stopping threats but it would create an image of authoritarianism, secrecy and inaccessibility.
The Capitol complex is for all the American people, and, with proper security, must remain open to them.
Permanent fencing would send an un-American message to the nation and the world, by transforming our democracy from one that is accessible, transparent and of the people to one that is closed off, secretive and fearful of its own citizens.
It would tell the world that the most powerful nation must rely on crude barriers for safety instead of state-of-the-art intelligence and security protocols.
The Capitol has welcomed First Amendment protests and demonstrations for centuries without becoming a fortress, The openness of the Capitol and our democracy is our strength, not a

security weakness that needs to be rooted out.
Any further consideration of permanent fencing is desperate, distasteful and disrespectful of our history and institutions.
Furthermore, the Capitol complex does not exist in a vacuum.
It is immediately surrounded by residential neighborhoods and local businesses, which form the heart of the District of Columbia.
Permanent fencing would cause serious damage to the fabric of these communities.
After January 6th, these residents and businesses were more than understanding as their neighborhoods turned into militarized zones.
They waited patiently as officers checked their identification on their walks home or took alternative routes when they found blocked streets.
Permanent fencing would infringe on their ability, as well as the general public's ability, to enjoy the public spaces that define our nation's capital.
The distance between government and the people has grown, with trust in government at historic lows.
Installing permanent fencing at the Capitol complex would only increase that distance.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________

Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today in honor of Community Health Center of Cape Cod's 25th anniversary.
Community Health Center (CHC) of Cape Cod was first established in 1998 by a group or volunteer doctors and nurses committed to providing free healthcare services to uninsured residents of the Cape and Islands.
CHC originally started as the Falmouth Free Clinic in the basement of Falmouth Hospital and served 600 patients in its first year.
Today, CHC serves over 25,000 patients and has locations in five towns across the Upper Cape.
It was also recently announced that CHC received a five-million-dollar grant through the American Rescue Plan to open a new location to serve more patients on Cape Cod.
The new facility will be LEED silver certified and include affordable housing to support the community and workforce.
Since 2003, CHC has been led by CEO, Karen Gardner.
