In the decades since it was enacted, the ICWA has been labeled the gold standard of child welfare policy.
This law consistently establishes best practices to protect Indigenous children and preserve the integrity of Indigenous cultures and identities.
Veronica currently serves as the Leadership Analyst for the Majority Leader in the New Mexico House of Representatives.
In addition, she is the Vice President of the Board of Directors of Court-Appointed Special Advocates for Children (CASA), First Judicial District, a senior member of the National Foster Youth and Alumni Policy Council, a member of the National Child Welfare and Racial Equity (CWARE) Collaborative, and the Co-Chair of the Training Committee for the New Mexico Partners.
Veronica works tirelessly to give a voice to children and youth in Tribal families, and in New Mexico as a whole, that are impacted by the child welfare system.
I would like to thank Veronica for working every day as a champion to instill hope in our future generations. ____________________
