PIFHER ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Technical Sergeant Frank L. Pifher for his dedicated and humble service to our Nation in the United States Army.
Frank, a Flint, Michigan, native answered our Nation's call and enlisted in United States Armed Forces in 1952.
Frank served honorably in the Korean War in 1953 with the Armored Cavalry, seeing combat as a Tank Commander and spending 11 months overseas.
He earned the Korean Service Medal with two Bronze Service Stars, the Good Conduct Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal in gallant service to his country.
After returning stateside, Frank was stationed at Camp Carson in Colorado, where he was honorably discharged from the Army on May 5th, 1954.
While overseas, Frank had frequently written to a pen pal, who was serving as a wartime nurse back in Michigan.
Upon his separation from the military, Frank married his beloved pen pal, Mary Lou.
In their 70 years of marriage, they had four children--Tim, Janet, Rebecca and James.
Rebecca and James went on to serve honorably in the Marine Corps themselves.
In addition to their children, Frank and Mary Lou were blessed with five grandchildren, two step-grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and two step-great-grandchildren.
The Pifhers currently reside in Tuscarora Township where they have lived for 34 years.
Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Technical Sergeant Frank L. Pifher for his exemplary service to the United States of America.
Our gratitude extends to him not only for his courage and humility, but also for his legacy of service that he has passed down to his children and their children.
May God bless Frank and his family. ____________________
RECOGNIZING VERONICA KRUPNICK; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.

Date: 2024-02-09 Volume: 170, Issue: 24 Pages: E129 - E129 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING VERONICA KRUPNICK ______ of new mexico in the house of representatives Ms. STANSBURY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Veronica Krupnick of Santa Fe, New Mexico, who was selected by Casey Excellence for Children Awards to receive the 2024 Alumni Award.
Veronica is the first Indigenous person to have been selected for this great honor.
She is an enrolled member of the Hopi Tribe of Arizona and has Jemez Pueblo and Navajo Nation heritage.
Veronica is a mentor, a leader, and an unwavering advocate for children and youth in New Mexico's child welfare system.
Drawing upon her own experience in the foster care system, Veronica's advocacy and mentorship centers around the importance of connecting children and youth in the child welfare system to their cultural identities, communities, and traditions.
Last year, she played a crucial role in upholding the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), which was under threat by a case heard before the Supreme Court.
The ICWA mandates that when the government seeks foster and adoption placement for a child who is a member of or eligible for membership in an Indian Tribe, it must give preference to those with kin or Tribal relationships to the child.
In the decades since it was enacted, the ICWA has been labeled the gold standard of child welfare policy.
This law consistently establishes best practices to protect Indigenous children and preserve the integrity of Indigenous cultures and identities.
Veronica currently serves as the Leadership Analyst for the Majority Leader in the New Mexico House of Representatives.
