To the contrary, based on the facts of which I am aware, Secretary Mayorkas appears to be a capable, dedicated public servant trying as best he can to carry out the policy priorities of the President of the United States and to manage the perennial and intractable problems related to immigration and control of the U.S. southern border. ____________________

Date: 2024-02-09 Volume: 170, Issue: 24 Pages: E130 - E130 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING AMERICA'S CREDIT UNIONS ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. CALVERT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the importance of credit unions in the competitive financial services marketplace.
I especially appreciate the 263 credit unions and their 14 million members in my state of California.
The country's two storied trade associations, the Credit Union National Association and the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions are now merged into a new organization called ``America's Credit Unions.''
As a long-time credit union member and supporter, I appreciate the difference between credit unions and banks.
Credit unions are not-for- profit financial cooperatives that are democratically controlled.
Every member, regardless of how much they have in savings or loans at a credit union, has an equal voice and vote in the governance of their credit union.
There are no outside stockholders and no motive for the credit union's leadership to gouge the membership or provide poor member service.
In fact, credit unions consistently rank as the most popular form of depository institutions in America.
So today I congratulate the unification of the two national credit union advocacy organizations and I expect great things to come from this newly-minted trade organization called ``America's Credit Unions.'' ____________________

Date: 2024-02-09 Volume: 170, Issue: 24 Pages: E129 - E129 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING PHOENIX OASIS ______ of arizona in the house of representatives Mr. GOSAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the good work of a Phoenix-based veterans care facility called Phoenix Oasis.
Phoenix Oasis, headed by its Director Anthony Pfeffer, demonstrated its commitment to our veterans and offered key assistance to U.S. Vets- Phoenix.
When U.S. Vets lost its lease, but did not yet have a new facility ready, Phoenix Oasis stepped in and allowed U.S. Vets to continue serving veterans.
U.S. Vets stayed and offered services to veterans for months after the lease had expired, and in that way, Phoenix Oasis allowed veterans in need to have continuity of care in a stable and supportive environment.
Indeed, Mr. Pfeffer prioritized providing assistance to U.S. Vets notwithstanding the needs of his own program at Phoenix Oasis.
The veterans served by U.S. Vets benefitted tremendously by this compassionate effort and the sacrifices made by Phoenix Oasis and Mr. Pfeffer.
It is commendable that Mr. Pfeffer and Phoenix Oasis take their responsibilities to our veterans so deeply and personally.
It is rare these days to see that level of commitment and I applaud them in so doing.
It is also the 10th anniversary of the founding of Phoenix Oasis.
The dedicated staff at Phoenix Oasis have provided a decade of service delivering safe housing and substance abuse treatment services to thousands of veterans during that time.
And they did so with dignity and respect to our veterans.
Our veterans helped America when we needed them.
When our veterans need help, people like Mr. Pfeffer and Phoenix Oasis step in.
I thank them on behalf of everyone they have helped in the last decade. ____________________
