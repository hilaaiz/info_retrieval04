Date: 2023-07-28 Volume: 169, Issue: 131 Pages: E744 - E745 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E744-E745] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING GOODFELLOWS ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Goodfellows, a charitable organization, based in the city of Dearborn in Michigan's 12th District Strong, as they celebrate 100 years of giving.
Founded in 1923 as the Good Cheer Club, Goodfellows is Dearborn's oldest charitable organization.
Local business owners came together to raise money by selling newspapers to ensure ``no child without Christmas.''
That became the organization's motto.
Over the years, Goodfellows has grown in its reach and capacity, partnering with local fire and police departments to serve families in need from far beyond its beginnings in Dearborn.
Countless families can count on their holiday gift distribution program, an event I happily volunteer my time to each year.
And even more families are served by their school supply drives, scholarships and even emergency funding.
Dearborn Goodfellows relies heavily on committed volunteers every year who bring heart to everything they do.
Please join me in recognizing Goodfellows of Dearborn for its outstanding work and commitment to serving families in need. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Reverend Solomon W. Kinloch, Jr.'s incredible community and pastoral leadership in Michigan's 12th Congressional District.
Reverend Solomon W. Kinloch, Jr. was born to the late Solomon, Sr.
and Janie Cousar Kinloch on July 28, 1973.
He began his work in ministry under the tutelage of Rev. Robert Smith, Jr. at the New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan.
In 1998, Reverend Kinloch accepted his call to pastor at Triumph Church in Detroit, Michigan.
At the beginning of his tenure, Triumph Church's membership was less than 50 people.
Under Rev. Kinloch's visionary leadership, Triumph Church has since grown into several campuses with thirteen weekly services for more than 40,000 members.
During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Reverend Kinloch spearheaded the expansion of Triumph Church's outreach with the creation of `Drive-In Church' at their Southfield location and 6 online worship services, spreading hope and helping the community stay connected when they could not safely gather in person.
Reverend Kinloch held prayer calls to help our community and their membership remain grounded in their faith and continuing to spread joy amongst fear.
Reverend Kinloch ensured our communities had access to basic needs for their ability to not just survive the pandemic but thrive, by providing free laptops for members in need and other essentials like food and access to testing.
Reverend Kinloch's year-round exemplary leadership will always be a testament to his unwavering faith and his commitment and drive to serve others.
Please join me in recognition of Reverend Kinloch's numerous accomplishments and service to the people of Michigan's 12th District.
We thank him for his service and wish him well. ____________________
