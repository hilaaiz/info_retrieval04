Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Private First-Class Richard Barancik who passed away on July 14, 2023.
He was the final surviving member of the ``Monuments Men'', the World War II heroes who were responsible for finding and safeguarding the artistic and cultural achievements of western civilization stolen by the Nazis.
Private First-Class Barancik enlisted in the Army and joined the 42nd Division, 232 Infantry in Austria, where he learned of the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, and, applied for duty.
For several weeks, Private First-Class Barancik and his unit assisted in the movement of stolen art treasures to the central repository of Property Control Branch and served as its guards.
From his arrival in Salzburg, he was enamored with the dedication of the citizenry to art.
After his service, he would go on to attend Cambridge University in London, finish his architecture degree at the University of Illinois, and found an eponymous architecture firm that designed numerous buildings, campuses, and dwellings throughout Illinois.
Private First-Class Barancik is remembered as a man of sharp mind and strong conviction, a lover of art, and a devoted father and grandfather.
When I first learned about the Monuments Men and Women, I was struck by their story and wanted to recognize the brave men and women of this unit for their contributions during World War II.
In 2014, I had the opportunity to sponsor the Monuments Men Recognition Act which awarded their unit with the Congressional Gold Medal, and I was thrilled when it was signed into law.
I was lucky to have the opportunity to meet Richard Barancik, and 4 of the other Monuments Men and Women in 2015 at the presentation ceremony of their Congressional Gold Medal.
They fought tirelessly against an unwavering evil to preserve the greater parts of our history and I am immensely proud to say that I have been a supporter of the Monuments Men and Women Foundation from its inception.
The closing of Richard Barancik's final chapter again underscores the reality that our Nation's veterans of World War II have already begun to recede from our present, and into the endless window of our memories.
His work, viewed through this lens, has bestowed to younger generations the highest legacy to which any man could aspire.
Without the service of his unit, great treasures of history and art would have been irrevocably lost.
Our country, and our world, owes Mr. Barancik the greatest honor, both in memory and in practice.
Rest in peace Private First-Class Barancik, an irreplaceable part of our Nation's greatest triumph, and an American hero in his own right. ____________________
