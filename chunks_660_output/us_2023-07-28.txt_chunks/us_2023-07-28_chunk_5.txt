Date: 2023-07-28 Volume: 169, Issue: 131 Pages: E745 - E745 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF THE WOOD COUNTY FAIR UPON THE CELEBRATION OF ITS 150TH ANNIVERSARY ______ of ohio in the house of representatives Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Wood County Agricultural Society on the 150th Anniversary of the Wood County Fair.
Since 1873, the Wood County Fair has been a proud tradition of Northwest Ohio and has served as an outlet for county residents to showcase their talents, skills, and benevolence.
Over the course of 150 years, the Fair has continued to promote the county's heritage, bring the community together, and encourage friendly competition with the junior fair.
The first Wood County Fair was held near the corner of today's W. Wooster and N. Grove Streets in Bowling Green, Ohio.
Between 1851 to 1885, it was held in various locations around Wood County including Bowling Green, Perrysburg, Portage, and Tontogany.
From 1882 to 1927, the fair was held in what is now the Bowling Green City Park.
Although there was not an official fair between 1928 to 1950, events that highlighted and celebrated the county's agriculture base included Tomato Festivals, Harvest Festivals, and Fall Festivals.
The fair has been held at the current location since 1951.
Although the first fair wasn't held until 1873, Wood County's beginnings set the foundation for the agricultural spirit that is still felt today during the fair.
Wood County was once home to the Great Black Swamp.
This made settlement of the area extremely difficult, but the pioneering spirit of early residents produced an extensive system of ditches, which drained the swamp and revealed the rich farmland beneath.
There are still more than 3,000 miles of drainage ditches keeping the county dry to this day, and agriculture continues to power Wood County's economy.
Even after the population spiked due to the discovery of oil and natural gas in the late 1800s, agriculture continued to dominate Wood County's economy.
The county supports the rural traditions and history of the area that fosters agricultural ingenuity, manufacturing developments, and educational success.
All of these factors have contributed to a successful fair that highlights all aspects of the county.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to the Wood County Agricultural Society on this significant milestone.
On behalf of the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Ohio, I wish the Wood County Agricultural Society continued success on this 150th Wood County Fair.
