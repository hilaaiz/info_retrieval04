TOMMIE L. LEWIS AS PASTOR OF BETHEL MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH PRATT CITY ______ of alabama in the house of representatives Ms. SEWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary career of a faithful servant leader, Reverend Dr. Tommie L. Lewis, as he celebrates his retirement as senior pastor of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church Pratt City after 42 years of service to the Birmingham community.
Pastor T.L. Lewis answered the call to ministry on January 6, 1973, becoming licensed to preach at the Shady Grove Missionary Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, and was ordained by incumbent Reverend G.W. Sloan on July 29, 1973.
Pastor Lewis is an accomplished biblical scholar.
He attended the Birmingham Easonian Baptist Bible College, earning a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Theology before earning a Master of Divinity degree at Universal Bible Institute in Brunswick, Georgia.
Pastor Lewis received two honorary doctoral degrees from both his alma maters for his contributions to ministry through his public service.
Pastor Lewis accepted his first pastoral assignment at the First Baptist Church Carver in Bessemer, Alabama.
He then served at the Antioch Baptist Church in Gadsden, Alabama.
In 1982, Pastor Lewis was commissioned to his final home in Birmingham as head pastor of Bethel Baptist Church Pratt City, where he has remained for the past 42 years of his career.
During his tenure, Pastor Lewis has served ``Bethel Nation,'' well, expanding its congregation to thousands and positioning the church to its status as a beacon of hope in the Pratt City community.
Pastor Lewis' legacy has been fueled by his servant's heart, commitment to community, and passion for improving the lives of others.
His position as a powerful force for good extends far beyond the sanctuary walls.
Pastor Lewis has dedicated his life to building a coalition of community servants that will far outlast him.
His tutelage led to fifty-three others heeding the call to ministry that Pastor Lewis himself answered fifty-two years ago.
In 1990, the Bethel Baptist Church erected a new Worship Center, including a sanctuary with a seating capacity of 1800, an office plaza, a conference room, a library, and a nursery.
Pastor Lewis worked to expand Bethel's community service by commissioning a new Family Life Center.
This building also became a permanent home for the Bethel Community Learning Center, which garnered thousands of state and federal dollars to support community development and education initiatives.
Tragically, in April of 2011, these buildings were destroyed by a devastating tornado.
In the face of adversity, Pastor Lewis did not hesitate to spring into action, leaning on his faith to rally his community together and restore their church home.
