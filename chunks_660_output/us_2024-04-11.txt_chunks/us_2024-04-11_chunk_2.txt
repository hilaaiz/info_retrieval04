Date: 2024-04-11 Volume: 170, Issue: 62 Pages: E336 - E336 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING SIXTH BAPTIST CHURCH'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.
JENNIFER L. McCLELLAN of virginia in the house of representatives Ms. McCLELLAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Sixth Baptist Church in Richmond, Virginia.
In 1923, Reverend Edward D. Caffee led 25 members from Mount Carmel Baptist Church to establish a Mission, initially known as St. Luke's Mission.
Despite initial challenges in obtaining recognition, on December 12, 1923, the Mission was officially recognized as St. Luke Baptist Church.
Under Reverend Caffee's guidance, the church flourished, moving to North Sixth Street in 1924, where it held its first service on December 28, 1924.
In November 1927, the Reverend Joseph Arrington was appointed as pastor of Sixth Baptist Church.
At Arrington's recommendation and with the congregation's consent, the church officially changed its name from St. Luke Baptist Church to Sixth Street Baptist Church.
Despite financial struggles during the Great Depression, the church persevered, paying off its mortgage in 1944.
In 1952, recognizing the changing landscape of Richmond, the congregation moved to the West End, renaming itself Sixth Baptist Church.
Under the leadership of Reverend Arrington, the church's membership grew to an astounding 350 members.
After 33 years of faithful service, Reverend Arrington stepped down as pastor, paving the way for the appointment of Haywood Knight as Sixth Baptist Church's new senior pastor.
Under Reverend Knight's leadership, the church renovated its fellowship hall and established the Fellowship Club and Youth Church.
Reverend Knight served as pastor until 1968, when Reverend Dr. Emmett L. Fleming Sr.
became the fourth pastor of the church.
Under Reverend Dr. Fleming's tenure, the church embarked on ambitious projects, including erecting an educational building and renovating the sanctuary.
His legacy of community outreach and ministry development laid a strong foundation for the future.
In 2001, Reverend Dr. Yvonne Jones Bibbs became the fifth pastor of Sixth Baptist Church, continuing the tradition of stewardship and community engagement.
As pastor, Rev. Dr. Bibbs has overseen the church through two phases of construction and renovations to improve facilities and worship spaces for the growing congregation.
Throughout its 100 years, Sixth Baptist Church has remained a steadfast place of worship for congregants and members of the Richmond community.
As we celebrate Sixth Baptist Church's centennial, we honor the past, embrace the present, and look forward to a future filled with continued growth and service. ____________________
