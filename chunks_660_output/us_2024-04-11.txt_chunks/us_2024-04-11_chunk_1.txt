Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize the David Chapel Missionary Baptist Church's celebration of its 100th anniversary this year.
In 1924, 28 African American members founded the Church out of a former blacksmith's shop in Austin, Texas.
David Chapel would move twice, landing in its current site at MLK and Chestnut in 1958.
Its membership continued to expand, and the need for larger accommodations became clear.
At the height of racial segregation in the American South, White-owned banks refused to provide the loans necessary for the building of a new space of worship.
Undeterred, David Chapel pursued the funds, development, and construction they needed for the structure, becoming a truly community- driven project.
Additionally, the building was designed by John Chase, the first Black graduate of the University of Texas at Austin's School of Architecture.
Through the commitment and dedication of many, the construction of the current David Chapel Missionary Baptist Church building was finished only a year after it started.
Since 1992, David Chapel has been led by its Senior Pastor, Rev. Joseph C. Parker, Jr., Esq.,
D. Min.
Under Rev. Parker's leadership, David Chapel has increased its community involvement by developing and implementing the Chestnut Neighborhood Plan, and co-founding the Texas Congregations United for Empowerment (TCUE), an organization of Black churches in Central Texas working to increase their economic and community empowerment.
As the Congressman representing the 35th District of Texas, I am honored to congratulate Rev. Packer and David Chapel Missionary Baptist Church on its 100th anniversary of providing spiritual guidance and serving the needs of our community in East Austin and beyond. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Frisco Garden Club's Wildflower Luncheon in Frisco, Texas.
In 2002, the City of Frisco established a memorial composed of wildflowers in honor of the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks on our Nation.
In the following year, Frisco Garden Club member Edna Willits proposed the addition of a native plant garden and monument at the memorial.
Through her passionate advocacy and dedication, the Freedom Meadow memorial was constructed.
In benefit of Freedom Meadow, the Club held its first ``Wildflower Tea and Silent Auction'' on April 29, 2004.
This successful luncheon yielded the Club over $4,500 and allowed Freedom Meadow to expand into the beautiful and moving monument it is today.
Since then, the Club has hosted the Wildflower Luncheon every year to raise funds in support of gardens throughout Frisco and conservation initiatives for Texas bluebirds.
Additionally, the Club has annually awarded two high school seniors with scholarships thanks to funds raised from this event.
I am proud to recognize the Frisco Garden Club's incredible efforts to support and uplift our community.
Their important work represents American strength, hope, and resolve against those who would harm us.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol in recognition of this historic occasion.
I wish the Frisco Garden Club and the Wildflower Luncheon continued success for many more years to come. ____________________
