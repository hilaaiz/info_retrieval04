Therefore, I am not asking for a radical, partisan rewrite: I am asking for a conversation.
It is up to you to reevaluate the priorities of our nation . . .
before it's too late.
As a sixteen-year-old constituent, it is of imperative importance to me that the planet of my future is managed sustainably, and that carelessness does not forever eliminate the tonic of wildness that makes our Earth a home. ____________________
